# Punch Control

## What is this

Punch Control is a simple work hours tracker. 

## How does it work

Punch Control uses `arp-scan` to find devices connected to your wifi network, and associates their MAC addresses to the employees. It logs connected devices every minutes and inserts the check-in and check-out times into a `.csv` file at the end of every day.
